You're working for a russian intelligence agency during a war sometime in the war. You intercept letters between a german and a russian person. They seem to be encrypted in some way, and the sender and receiver are in places very difficult to reach. You'd like to be sure that these are actually suspicious before sending people there. 

The **first letter** you intercept has some green paint spilled on it. The letter contains some crypting writing: 

```
o soyy eua, cnkt igt ck skkz gmgot?
```

The only other information on the letter is the post stamp, dated to the 3rd of March 1943.

(decipher it now)

Sadly, even before you began work on it, it was held up for a few days, so it will arrive many days later than might be expected by the receiver, which might alert them.


The **second letter** you intercept has green paint on it as well, and it contains the writing:

```
ati jh wdet iwpi lt rpc, hddc. lt rdjas dc iwt 1hi du pegxa, btti lxiw gdhth pi iwt rwjgrw?
```

It's dated 12th of March 1943.

(decipher it now)

The **third letter** looks different, it has red paint on it. It says:

```
gxxkz xam gb lmxgkha rgt mnhut rkkhp hm xota xp eebp?
```

It's dated the 16th of March 1943.

Your superior is pressuring you to decipher this one, as the 1st of april might be an important day for the allies. He is not willing to tell you more, but pressures you to find out what this one says.

The **fourth letter arrives**, with green paint once again. 

```
sym. nbcm wbuhhyf cmhn muzy. xcmvuhx.
```

It's dated the 17th of March 1943.

(decipher it now)

Your superior comes to visit, he now wants to know how the decryption works, as a new mass of around 50 letters have been intercepted and a new task force will be formed. He also wants to know how you assert the threat level (can you find out what they are talking about?). What do you say?
